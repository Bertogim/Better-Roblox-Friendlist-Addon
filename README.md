# Better Roblox Friendlist Addon

This addon -> https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/Better%20Roblox%20Friendslist/eadpdfjhlpoalfnipgacnipgbobpjohh was outdated and i decided to fix it! I also added a few more things.

Now that addon is back after like 5 months, storing last online locally too, but you cant export it there, so the data can be loosed.

**This fork still has some interesting features**

## Differences from original addon:
- Peforms much better
- Saves last online friends data locally (Can be saved and loaded)
- You can enable settings like transitions clicking the addon in your browser addons tab
- Panel sticks to the right and the chat button is always visible
- Compatible with roblokis
- I will actually fix things quickly not like the original owner

# You can install it on the [releases section](https://github.com/Bertogim/Better-Roblox-Friendlist-Addon/releases/)
Download the crx file and it should be installed!
