# Better Roblox Friendlist Addon

This addon -> https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/Better%20Roblox%20Friendslist/eadpdfjhlpoalfnipgacnipgbobpjohh was outdated and i decided to fix it! I also added a few more things.

# You can install it on the releases section: https://github.com/Bertogim/Better-Roblox-Friendlist-Addon/releases/
Download the crx file and it should be installed!

## Differences from original addon:
- Saves last online friends data locally (Can be saved and loaded)
- Transition setting
- Panel sticks to the right
- Compatible with roblokis
